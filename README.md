# Analyzing Ephemeral2 Logs

This repository is to parse and analyze the logs collected during the
[Ephemeral2](https://github.com/losvedir/ephemeral2) experiment.

The logs are in the `log_data` folder.

The code that runs through the logs is in `lib`. This project is built
as an elixir application, and can be run with `mix run` and tested with
`mix test`.
